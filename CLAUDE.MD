## How I want you to work

### Before coding
- Ask clarifying questions before starting
- Draft a plan for complex work and confirm before coding
- if unsure, ask - don't asume


### While Coding
- write complete working code - no placeholders, no TODOs
- Keep it simple and readable over clever
- Follow existing patterns int eh codebase
- one change at a time, verify as you go. 


### After coding
- run tests to verify your changes work. 
run linter/formatter before finishing
- Summarize what you changed and why in the project-roadmap.md
